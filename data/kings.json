Due to his unruly behavior, he was banished with 700 followers. They landed in Lanka, at a site named Tambapanni, on the day of the Buddha's Parinirvana. There, he and his followers defeated the native Yakkhas with the help of the Yakkha princess Kuveni, whom he married. He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni, but later abandoned Kuveni and their two children to marry a princess from the Pandyan kingdom in Madurai, India, to legitimize his rule. His followers also married women from Madurai. This union is considered the origin of the Sinhalese people. He ruled for 38 years, and his reign is marked as the beginning of the recorded history of Sri Lanka."

The most significant event of his reign was the arrival of Arahat Mahinda, Ashoka's son, who converted the king and his court to Buddhism at the historic site of Mihintale. Following his conversion, Devanampiya Tissa became a great patron of the faith, establishing the Mahavihara monastery and building the Thuparama stupa, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. His reign also saw the arrival of Sanghamitta, Ashoka's daughter, who brought a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree from Bodh Gaya, which was planted in Anuradhapura and is revered to this day.

Arahant Mahinda passed away in the eighth year of Uttiya's reign, and the king held a grand funeral for him, building a stupa on the site of his cremation at Mihintale. Sanghamitta Theri passed away the following year, and she was also honored with a stupa. These events underscore the consolidation of Buddhism as the state religion during his time."

Despite being an invader, Elara is renowned in Sri Lankan history for his exceptionally just and impartial rule, which lasted for 44 years. The Mahavamsa chronicle, though a Sinhalese Buddhist text, praises him for his righteousness and describes his 'Bell of Justice,' which citizens could ring to demand his personal attention for any grievance. The most famous legend tells of him ordering the execution of his own son as retribution for a calf that the son's chariot had accidentally killed. His long reign was eventually challenged by the Sinhalese prince Dutugemunu from the south. The conflict culminated in a legendary duel between the two kings on elephant-back, where the elderly Elara was finally defeated and killed.

A shrewd and pious ruler, he focused on strengthening his kingdom from within. He built numerous temples and viharas, fostering a strong sense of national and religious unity. He also gathered the resources and manpower necessary for a future war, including recruiting the 'Ten Giant Warriors' (Dasha Maha Yodhayo) who would later become instrumental in his son's campaign.

After his father's death and a brief conflict with his own brother, Tissa, Dutugemunu launched his famous campaign. Aided by his loyal war elephant, Kandula, and his 'Ten Giant Warriors,' he waged a series of battles, culminating in a legendary elephant-back duel where he defeated and killed the elderly King Elara. Despite being an adversary, Dutugemunu showed great respect for Elara's bravery, building a monument in his honor. As king, Dutugemunu became a great patron of Buddhism, initiating the construction of some of the most iconic structures in Anuradhapura, including the massive Ruwanwelisaya stupa and the magnificent nine-story Lovamahapaya (Brazen Palace).
