According to the Mahāvaṃsa, he was the son of King Sinhabahu of Sinhapura in India. Due to his unruly behavior, he was banished with 700 followers. They landed in Lanka, at a site named Tambapanni, on the day of the Buddha&#x27;s Parinirvana. There, he and his followers defeated the native Yakkhas with the help of the Yakkha princess Kuveni, whom he married. He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni, but later abandoned Kuveni and their two children to marry a princess from the Pandyan kingdom in Madurai, India, to legitimize his rule. His followers also married women from Madurai. This union is considered the origin of the Sinhalese people. He ruled for 38 years, and his reign is marked as the beginning of the recorded history of Sri Lanka. King Vijaya&#x27;s arrival and the subsequent marriages of his followers with princesses from India is traditionally considered the origin of the Sinhalese people and culture in Sri Lanka. His reign marks the beginning of Sri Lanka&#x27;s recorded history, chronicled in the ancient text Mahāvaṃsa.</p></a></div></div><div class="flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors"><div class="flex-shrink-0 w-40"><div class="text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]">505–504 BCE</div><a class="text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline" href="/History-/kingdoms/tambapanni">Tambapanni</a></div><div class="flex-1"><a class="group" href="/History-/kings/upatissa-regent"><h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors">Upatissa (regent)</h3><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2">Upatissa was a chief minister of King Vijaya and the regent of Sri Lanka for one year after Vijaya&#x27;s death.

Raised in secrecy, he eventually waged a seventeen-year war against his uncles, defeated them, and unified the island. He established Anuradhapura as his capital, a city he meticulously planned and developed. His reign of 70 years was marked by significant achievements, including the construction of reservoirs (such as the Abhaya Wewa), the establishment of a formal administrative system, and the peaceful integration of different clans.

His most significant contribution was the creation of the Mahamevnāwa (Great Clouds) Park in Anuradhapura, a beautifully landscaped garden that he laid out with fruit and flowering trees. This park would later become a site of immense religious importance, as it was where the sacred Bodhi tree was planted during the reign of his successor.

He was the son of King Mutasiva and maintained a close friendship with the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka of India. The most significant event of his reign was the arrival of Arahat Mahinda, Ashoka&#x27;s son, who converted the king and his court to Buddhism at the historic site of Mihintale. Following his conversion, Devanampiya Tissa became a great patron of the faith, establishing the Mahavihara monastery and building the Thuparama stupa, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. His reign also saw the arrival of Sanghamitta, Ashoka&#x27;s daughter, who brought a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree from Bodh Gaya, which was planted in Anuradhapura and is revered to this day.

His ten-year reign is historically significant primarily because it marks the passing of the two central figures who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka: Arahant Mahinda and his sister, Sanghamitta Theri. Arahant Mahinda passed away in the eighth year of Uttiya&#x27;s reign, and the king held a grand funeral for him, building a stupa on the site of his cremation at Mihintale. Sanghamitta Theri passed away the following year, and she was also honored with a stupa.

Despite being an invader, Elara is renowned in Sri Lankan history for his exceptionally just and impartial rule, which lasted for 44 years. The Mahavamsa chronicle, though a Sinhalese Buddhist text, praises him for his righteousness and describes his &#x27;Bell of Justice,&#x27; which citizens could ring to demand his personal attention for any grievance. The most famous legend tells of him ordering the execution of his own son as retribution for a calf that the son&#x27;s chariot had accidentally killed. His long reign was eventually challenged by the Sinhalese prince Dutugemunu from the south. The conflict culminated in a legendary duel between the two kings on elephant-back, where the elderly Elara was finally defeated and killed. Dutugemunu, in a mark of great respect, had a monument built for Elara and ordered that all should pay respect to it.</p></a></div></div><div class="flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors"><div class="flex-shrink-0 w-40"><div class="text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]">161–137 BCE</div><a class="text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline" href="/History-/kingdoms/anuradhapura">Anuradhapura Kingdom</a></div><div class="flex-1"><a class="group" href="/History-/kings/dutugemunu"><h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors">King Dutugemunu</h3><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2">Dutugemunu is one of the most celebrated heroes in Sri Lankan history, revered for liberating and unifying the island under a single banner. As the son of King Kavan Tissa of Ruhuna, he was driven from a young age by the desire to expel the Chola king Elara, who ruled Anuradhapura. After his father&#x27;s death and a brief conflict with his own brother, Tissa, Dutugemunu launched his famous campaign. Aided by his loyal war elephant, Kandula, and his &#x27;Ten Giant Warriors,&#x27; he waged a series of battles, culminating in a legendary elephant-back duel where he defeated and killed the elderly King Elara. Despite being an adversary, Dutugemunu showed great respect for Elara&#x27;s bravery, building a monument in his honor. As king, Dutugemunu became a great patron of Buddhism, initiating the construction of some of the most iconic structures in Anuradhapura, including the massive Ruwanwelisaya stupa and the magnificent nine-story Lovamahapaya (Brazen Palace). His reign is considered a golden age of Sinhalese nationalism and religious devotion.</p></a></div></div><div class="flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors"><div class="flex-shrink-0 w-40"><div class="text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]">137–119 BCE</div><a class="text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline" href="/History-/kingdoms/ruhuna">Ruhuna</a></div><div class="flex-1"><a class="group" href="/History-/kings/saddha-tissa"><h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors">King Saddha Tissa</h3><p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2">King Saddha Tissa (137–119 BCE) – Saddha Tissa, younger brother of Dutugemunu, inherited a newly unified Anuradhapura where monumental Buddhist projects and hydraulic expansion had accelerated.

His reign sits between that of Voharika Tissa (known for measures against extremist ascetic practices) and Siri Naga III, forming part of a transitional cluster of monarchs whose short rules reflect underlying political fluidity. Primary sources such as the Mahāvaṃsa and related Pali chronicles provide only sparse details of Abhaya Naga II’s parentage and early life. He is generally placed within the broader line of rulers descending from earlier Anuradhapura dynasties that blended indigenous clans with the established Vijayan line. The paucity of inscriptional corroboration means many genealogical assumptions rely on later chronicler synthesis. The mid 3rd century CE in Anuradhapura was characterized by rapid turnover of kings and intermittent factional tension. Following reforms aimed at curbing heterodox or extreme monastic factions, the throne required careful navigation of both secular nobility and influential monastic groups. Abhaya Naga II’s short tenure suggests either limited consolidation of elite support or prevailing instability that favored swift succession. Although direct royal projects attributed to Abhaya Naga II are not securely recorded, the era continued broader trends: maintenance of existing vihāras, support for orthodox Theravāda establishments, and cautious restraint toward splinter ascetic movements. The absence of monumental works in his name likely reflects the brevity of his reign rather than deliberate cultural neglect. No surviving inscriptions explicitly document administrative reforms under Abhaya Naga II. Governance structures in this period generally relied on a triad: provincial chieftains (or rājaputas), monastic intellectual influence, and royal court stewards handling revenue from irrigation-based agrarian systems. Continuity rather than innovation appears to have defined his administration. Likely challenges included: (1) stabilizing succession legitimacy after prior doctrinal interventions; (2) balancing monastic patronage without reigniting sectarian controversy; (3) sustaining large-scale irrigation maintenance cycles initiated by earlier, longer-reigning monarchs. The short reign duration implies unresolved political pressures or emergent rival claimants. Abhaya Naga II was succeeded by Siri Naga III. His legacy is primarily that of a placeholder monarch within a compressed succession sequence—illustrating volatility before later, more stable rule phases. The lack of negative chronicler judgment (compared to clearly censured rulers) suggests his reign was administratively ordinary rather than disruptive. Information derives chiefly from the Mahāvaṃsa and later compendia; these textual sources were compiled centuries after events and mix historiography with legitimizing narrative. Absence of dedicated stone inscriptions or archaeological signatures for Abhaya Naga II necessitates cautious interpretation.

His reign sits between that of Voharika Tissa (known for measures against extremist ascetic practices) and Siri Naga III, forming part of a transitional cluster of monarchs whose short rules reflect underlying political fluidity. Primary sources such as the Mahāvaṃsa and related Pali chronicles provide only sparse details of Abhaya Naga II’s parentage and early life. He is generally placed within the broader line of rulers descending from earlier Anuradhapura dynasties that blended indigenous clans with the established Vijayan line. The paucity of inscriptional corroboration means many genealogical assumptions rely on later chronicler synthesis. The mid 3rd century CE in Anuradhapura was characterized by rapid turnover of kings and intermittent factional tension. Following reforms aimed at curbing heterodox or extreme monastic factions, the throne required careful navigation of both secular nobility and influential monastic groups. Abhaya Naga II’s short tenure suggests either limited consolidation of elite support or prevailing instability that favored swift succession. Although direct royal projects attributed to Abhaya Naga II are not securely recorded, the era continued broader trends: maintenance of existing vihāras, support for orthodox Theravāda establishments, and cautious restraint toward splinter ascetic movements. The absence of monumental works in his name likely reflects the brevity of his reign rather than deliberate cultural neglect. No surviving inscriptions explicitly document administrative reforms under Abhaya Naga II. Governance structures in this period generally relied on a triad: provincial chieftains (or rājaputas), monastic intellectual influence, and royal court stewards handling revenue from irrigation-based agrarian systems. Continuity rather than innovation appears to have defined his administration. Likely challenges included: (1) stabilizing succession legitimacy after prior doctrinal interventions; (2) balancing monastic patronage without reigniting sectarian controversy; (3) sustaining large-scale irrigation maintenance cycles initiated by earlier, longer-reigning monarchs. The short reign duration implies unresolved political pressures or emergent rival claimants. Abhaya Naga II was succeeded by Siri Naga III. His legacy is primarily that of a placeholder monarch within a compressed succession sequence—illustrating volatility before later, more stable rule phases. The lack of negative chronicler judgment (compared to clearly censured rulers) suggests his reign was administratively ordinary rather than disruptive. Information derives chiefly from the Mahāvaṃsa and later compendia; these textual sources were compiled centuries after events and mix historiography with legitimizing narrative. Absence of dedicated stone inscriptions or archaeological signatures for Abhaya Naga II necessitates cautious interpretation. Where specifics are missing, scholarly consensus defaults to broader structural patterns of Anuradhapura governance."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"44:[\"$\",\"div\",\"abhaya-naga-ii\",{\"className\":\"flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex-shrink-0 w-40\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]\",\"children\":\"247–249 CE\"}],[\"$\",\"$L7\",null,{\"href\":\"/kingdoms/anuradhapura\",\"className\":\"text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline\",\"children\":\"Anuradhapura Kingdom\"}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex-1\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"$L7\",null,{\"href\":\"/kings/abhaya-naga-ii\",\"className\":\"group\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"className\":\"text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors\",\"children\":\"King Abhaya Naga II\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2\",\"children\":\"$50\"}]]}]}]]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"45:[\"$\",\"div\",\"siri-naga-iii\",{\"className\":\"flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex-shrink-0 w-40\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]\",\"children\":\"249–251 CE\"}],[\"$\",\"$L7\",null,{\"href\":\"/kingdoms/anuradhapura\",\"className\":\"text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline\",\"children\":\"Anuradhapura Kingdom\"}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex-1\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"$L7\",null,{\"href\":\"/kings/siri-naga-iii\",\"className\":\"group\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h3\",null,{\"className\":\"text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors\",\"children\":\"King Siri Naga III\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2\",\"children\":\"Siri Naga III (249–251 CE) ruled briefly after Abhaya Naga II's short tenure.
