His reign sits between that of Voharika Tissa (known for measures against extremist ascetic practices) and Siri Naga III, forming part of a transitional cluster of monarchs whose short rules reflect underlying political fluidity. Primary sources such as the Mahāvaṃsa and related Pali chronicles provide only sparse details of Abhaya Naga II’s parentage and early life. He is generally placed within the broader line of rulers descending from earlier Anuradhapura dynasties that blended indigenous clans with the established Vijayan line. The paucity of inscriptional corroboration means many genealogical assumptions rely on later chronicler synthesis. The mid 3rd century CE in Anuradhapura was characterized by rapid turnover of kings and intermittent factional tension. Following reforms aimed at curbing heterodox or extreme monastic factions, the throne required careful navigation of both secular nobility and influential monastic groups. Abhaya Naga II’s short tenure suggests either limited consolidation of elite support or prevailing instability that favored swift succession. Although direct royal projects attributed to Abhaya Naga II are not securely recorded, the era continued broader trends: maintenance of existing vihāras, support for orthodox Theravāda establishments, and cautious restraint toward splinter ascetic movements. The absence of monumental works in his name likely reflects the brevity of his reign rather than deliberate cultural neglect. No surviving inscriptions explicitly document administrative reforms under Abhaya Naga II. Governance structures in this period generally relied on a triad: provincial chieftains (or rājaputas), monastic intellectual influence, and royal court stewards handling revenue from irrigation-based agrarian systems. Continuity rather than innovation appears to have defined his administration. Likely challenges included: (1) stabilizing succession legitimacy after prior doctrinal interventions; (2) balancing monastic patronage without reigniting sectarian controversy; (3) sustaining large-scale irrigation maintenance cycles initiated by earlier, longer-reigning monarchs. The short reign duration implies unresolved political pressures or emergent rival claimants. Abhaya Naga II was succeeded by Siri Naga III. His legacy is primarily that of a placeholder monarch within a compressed succession sequence—illustrating volatility before later, more stable rule phases. The lack of negative chronicler judgment (compared to clearly censured rulers) suggests his reign was administratively ordinary rather than disruptive. Information derives chiefly from the Mahāvaṃsa and later compendia; these textual sources were compiled centuries after events and mix historiography with legitimizing narrative. Absence of dedicated stone inscriptions or archaeological signatures for Abhaya Naga II necessitates cautious interpretation.
