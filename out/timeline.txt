8:T46f,King Vijaya is the legendary first king of Sri Lanka, known for founding the Sinhalese people. According to the Mahāvaṃsa, he was the son of King Sinhabahu of Sinhapura in India. Due to his unruly behavior, he was banished with 700 followers. They landed in Lanka, at a site named Tambapanni, on the day of the Buddha's Parinirvana. There, he and his followers defeated the native Yakkhas with the help of the Yakkha princess Kuveni, whom he married. He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni, but later abandoned Kuveni and their two children to marry a princess from the Pandyan kingdom in Madurai, India, to legitimize his rule. His followers also married women from Madurai. This union is considered the origin of the Sinhalese people. He ruled for 38 years, and his reign is marked as the beginning of the recorded history of Sri Lanka. King Vijaya's arrival and the subsequent marriages of his followers with princesses from India is traditionally considered the origin of the Sinhalese people and culture in Sri Lanka. His reign marks the beginning of Sri Lanka's recorded history, chronicled in the ancient text Mahāvaṃsa.0:{"P":null,"b":"uQNvQXSfIJwPXC-VbUWS2","p":"","c":["","timeline"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["timeline",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/b4b2a2f820f43f41.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","$L2",null,{"Component":"$3","slots":{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]},"params":{},"promise":"$@6"}]]}],{"children":["timeline",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto py-6 px-5","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl font-bold mb-4","children":"Historical Timeline"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400","children":"Complete chronological timeline of Sri Lankan monarchs spanning over 2,300 years"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-12","children":[["$","section","Ancient Period (543 BCE - 250 CE)",{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-[var(--accent)] border-b-2 border-[var(--accent)] pb-2","children":"Ancient Period (543 BCE - 250 CE)"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-4","children":[["$","div","vijaya",{"className":"flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-shrink-0 w-40","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]","children":"543–505 BCE"}],["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/kingdoms/tambapanni","className":"text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline","children":"Tambapanni"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1","children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/kings/vijaya","className":"group","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors","children":"King Vijaya"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2","children":"$8"}]]}]}]]}],"$L9","$La","$Lb","$Lc","$Ld","$Le","$Lf","$L10","$L11","$L12","$L13","$L14","$L15","$L16","$L17","$L18","$L19","$L1a","$L1b","$L1c","$L1d","$L1e","$L1f","$L20","$L21","$L22","$L23","$L24","$L25","$L26","$L27","$L28","$L29","$L2a","$L2b","$L2c","$L2d","$L2e","$L2f","$L30","$L31","$L32","$L33","$L34","$L35","$L36","$L37","$L38","$L39","$L3a","$L3b","$L3c","$L3d","$L3e","$L3f","$L40","$L41","$L42","$L43","$L44","$L45"]}],"$L46"]}],"$L47","$L48","$L49","$L4a"]}],"$L4b"]}],null,"$L4c"]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],"$L4d",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$4e",[]],"s":false,"S":true}

Despite being an invader, Elara is renowned in Sri Lankan history for his exceptionally just and impartial rule, which lasted for 44 years. The Mahavamsa chronicle, though a Sinhalese Buddhist text, praises him for his righteousness and describes his 'Bell of Justice,' which citizens could ring to demand his personal attention for any grievance. The most famous legend tells of him ordering the execution of his own son as retribution for a calf that the son's chariot had accidentally killed. His long reign was eventually challenged by the Sinhalese prince Dutugemunu from the south. The conflict culminated in a legendary duel between the two kings on elephant-back, where the elderly Elara was finally defeated and killed. Dutugemunu, in a mark of great respect, had a monument built for Elara and ordered that all should pay respect to it."}]]}]}]]}]
4f:T411,Dutugemunu is one of the most celebrated heroes in Sri Lankan history, revered for liberating and unifying the island under a single banner. As the son of King Kavan Tissa of Ruhuna, he was driven from a young age by the desire to expel the Chola king Elara, who ruled Anuradhapura. After his father's death and a brief conflict with his own brother, Tissa, Dutugemunu launched his famous campaign. Aided by his loyal war elephant, Kandula, and his 'Ten Giant Warriors,' he waged a series of battles, culminating in a legendary elephant-back duel where he defeated and killed the elderly King Elara. Despite being an adversary, Dutugemunu showed great respect for Elara's bravery, building a monument in his honor. As king, Dutugemunu became a great patron of Buddhism, initiating the construction of some of the most iconic structures in Anuradhapura, including the massive Ruwanwelisaya stupa and the magnificent nine-story Lovamahapaya (Brazen Palace). His reign is considered a golden age of Sinhalese nationalism and religious devotion.16:["$","div","dutugemunu",{"className":"flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-shrink-0 w-40","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]","children":"161–137 BCE"}],["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/kingdoms/anuradhapura","className":"text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline","children":"Anuradhapura Kingdom"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1","children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/kings/dutugemunu","className":"group","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors","children":"King Dutugemunu"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2","children":"$4f"}]]}]}]]}]

50:Tc7f,King Abhaya Naga II ruled the Anuradhapura Kingdom briefly from 247–249 CE, during a period marked by rapid succession and doctrinal debate within Sri Lankan Buddhism. His reign sits between that of Voharika Tissa (known for measures against extremist ascetic practices) and Siri Naga III, forming part of a transitional cluster of monarchs whose short rules reflect underlying political fluidity. Primary sources such as the Mahāvaṃsa and related Pali chronicles provide only sparse details of Abhaya Naga II’s parentage and early life. He is generally placed within the broader line of rulers descending from earlier Anuradhapura dynasties that blended indigenous clans with the established Vijayan line. The paucity of inscriptional corroboration means many genealogical assumptions rely on later chronicler synthesis. The mid 3rd century CE in Anuradhapura was characterized by rapid turnover of kings and intermittent factional tension. Following reforms aimed at curbing heterodox or extreme monastic factions, the throne required careful navigation of both secular nobility and influential monastic groups. Abhaya Naga II’s short tenure suggests either limited consolidation of elite support or prevailing instability that favored swift succession. Although direct royal projects attributed to Abhaya Naga II are not securely recorded, the era continued broader trends: maintenance of existing vihāras, support for orthodox Theravāda establishments, and cautious restraint toward splinter ascetic movements. The absence of monumental works in his name likely reflects the brevity of his reign rather than deliberate cultural neglect. No surviving inscriptions explicitly document administrative reforms under Abhaya Naga II. Governance structures in this period generally relied on a triad: provincial chieftains (or rājaputas), monastic intellectual influence, and royal court stewards handling revenue from irrigation-based agrarian systems. Continuity rather than innovation appears to have defined his administration. Likely challenges included: (1) stabilizing succession legitimacy after prior doctrinal interventions; (2) balancing monastic patronage without reigniting sectarian controversy; (3) sustaining large-scale irrigation maintenance cycles initiated by earlier, longer-reigning monarchs. The short reign duration implies unresolved political pressures or emergent rival claimants. Abhaya Naga II was succeeded by Siri Naga III. His legacy is primarily that of a placeholder monarch within a compressed succession sequence—illustrating volatility before later, more stable rule phases. The lack of negative chronicler judgment (compared to clearly censured rulers) suggests his reign was administratively ordinary rather than disruptive. Information derives chiefly from the Mahāvaṃsa and later compendia; these textual sources were compiled centuries after events and mix historiography with legitimizing narrative. Absence of dedicated stone inscriptions or archaeological signatures for Abhaya Naga II necessitates cautious interpretation. Where specifics are missing, scholarly consensus defaults to broader structural patterns of Anuradhapura governance.44:["$","div","abhaya-naga-ii",{"className":"flex items-start gap-6 p-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-shrink-0 w-40","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm font-semibold text-[var(--accent)]","children":"247–249 CE"}],["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/kingdoms/anuradhapura","className":"text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-[var(--accent)] hover:underline","children":"Anuradhapura Kingdom"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1","children":["$","$L7",null,{"href":"/kings/abhaya-naga-ii","className":"group","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white group-hover:text-[var(--accent)] transition-colors","children":"King Abhaya Naga II"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-1 line-clamp-2","children":"$50"}]]}]}]]}]
